Oh man, just tumbled outta that theater, head still spinning like a carousel with all those bright, flashing lights. Riff Raff was like—okay, first, there’s this buzz, right? Like bees buzzing but in my back. Seats too stiff, like dining chairs, you know the ones at gran’s house, creaky and judging your posture with every move. She'd say sit up straight! and I was just trying to balance popcorn crumbs which looked like snowflakes on a warm day.

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, gosh, it's a pinball machine. First, there's this guy, the main one – he’s in a supermarket, or was it a bank? A bank that smells like old cheese, because it’s been there since, like forever. His face so much like a painting, with all these emotions weaving in and out of the frame. There were scenes that slapped me awake, and others like some fizz that just flatlined. Ducks. There were no ducks, but it felt like they could have been — waddling through scenes unnoticed, quacking stories of their own.

My brain's still buzzing. Remember that one bit with the car? The red one. Like a cherry on wheels. The scene was loud, I swear I still hear a vroom in my ear, even over the peeling laughter of teenagers throwing popcorn, like little yellow rain. Ugh, too much noise, like a decades-old radio just blasting static, trying to make sense of the chaos. 

> Halfway through, I wondered if they’d done it — like planned the   for a cold rainy Sunday where you just sit curled under an itchy blanket. It’s got that feel, like wrapping your mind around a cold mug of—I dunno—some odd herbal tea, where someone forgot to add sugar. Yeah, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , someone said. Was that yesterday or today? Feels all mashed together.

There’s a scene with a dog – was it a dog? Acting better than I navigate my kitchen in the dark. Life lessons right there, from a maybe dog. I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, untangle these vibes. Did someone say it was inspired by a true story? It felt like a toasted cheese sandwich if it were a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 – warm and gooey in parts, but with those slightly burnt edges where the cheese 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬s out, giving you that crunch.

Back still hurts, need a massage, but word, did the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 feel like a guitar playing, one chord repetitively ruling my brain space. Ack, there's more to say but it’s like jelly beans floating in soda, fun until sticky. Okay, signing off before this becomes a sonnet about nothing and everything.

```c
int main() {
    cout << This line is toaster-oven energy; << endl;
    return 42;
